# Counter-App

First app project in Swift (coded through XCode), for iOS!! Woo!! 
This is a simple counter app, that has 3 buttons you can press, to either increment, decrement, or reset the counter.
Useful for when you want to count something, and your hands are full, and you've got one free finger and my app open, or something.

Enjoy!!

Any questions about how to get started with this, or just Swift/iOS/Apple stuff in general, hit me up at:
